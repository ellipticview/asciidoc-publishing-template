== Introduction
This repository is an example of how to publish your Asciidoc documentation on GitHub Pages.
This allows you to easily include code snippets in your documentation. E.g. if this was an HTML tutorial, we could include the code as:

.src/html/hello-world.html
----
include::../html/hello-world.html[]
----

include::steps.adoc[]

include::notes.adoc[]
